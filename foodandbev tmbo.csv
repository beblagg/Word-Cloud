 Did you purchase any items from the team store or retail kiosk on the concourse?

"Must do better. Need better, healthy choices. Staff the food stands with regular, knowledgeable employees."

Offer kraut on the dog like they do at the Brewer games. Check the ketchup more often as empty a lot.

We would love to have some healthy old options.

Long delay in food delivery happens about 50% of the time I order from our server.
"The lines are usually very long & the wait way too long. Have already missed entire quarters of the game waiting. The menu selections are ok, but need to be upgraded, with much more variety."
need more vegetarian options: ie: veggie dogs











extremely limited and never changing menu for courtside seats and courtside club.

Does it really matter? Why should buy overpriced and/or inedible food and drinks?
It's pricey.

You can only do so much with the building we have at this time. I get that. Wish we had more options!

"Either increase amount of food for certain items (entree type items) or decrease price. Not a lot of ""bang for your buck""."



I think the food at the BC is very underrated. Great options and quality. Price is a little high but to be expected at games at this point.

"I usually eat at Ms. Katie's Dinner, so I do not buy a lot of food, mostly just snacks. but I enjoy the private Bartender in the U-line Suite."
Already said this earlier - concessions are over priced.

way behind the times in food choices


"Way too expensive, didn't buy anything at last game becuase price has become proiitive."


Only thing that I would say would be to bring something unique to the stadium like the Packers and Brewers have done with there food like there specialty foods.
"Sometimes the size of chicken tenders are very small and when they are small, they are very dry. We would like to see either bigger chicken tenders or receive more of them."
The speed and customer service is terrible!

"Carry Bud Lt and more craft breweries like Founders, Milwaukee Brewing, Oskar Blues, and Sand Creek. Have more food choices and dessert choices. How about a Custard stand? How about a sub sandwich?"


"The Bucks have a food stand called The Carvery, which is the only food at the arena I would eat. It costs a lot more than the regular food stand items, but it's worth it. The Bucks have a decent beer selection too. They could, perhaps, add a few more microbrew or local beer options, but it's mostly fine."
Expensive so I avoid it
A more unique selection would be good. Not just the standard options every arena has. Tie in the heritage of Milwaukee or where a certain player comes from.

"There seems to be many more options now, but haven't tried as many as i'd like."

none
Offer more options like what the United Center has. 

Run more deals/specials.

The ice cream is too expensive..
Prices are a little high which is common for sports arenas. Our family usually eats before we come to the arena and only buy popcorn and drinks.

cheaper would be nifty



MVP Club food is great.

feature more local restaurants!
No

No food is really good


N/A
Need more than just meat!!! Could you get some Japanese/Asian fusion snacks???
I feel we need more exotic foods and the soda prices are crazy high

Milwaukee needs much better food options at the arena. I almost never eat dinner there.
Too much of the same food. Need more healthy options.

"like the variety. I like local options and specialty items i.e., gluten free or fruit smoothies"


"I mentioned it earlier in the survey. Some additional comments would be: on the side concourse food vendor carts you can see dust that has built up game after game. Pricing can get high for someone who purchases at virtually all games attended. Many times I see fans not able to get condiments simply because no one has refilled them - attention to detail. Quality control needs to be better (hot items not as hot as they should be, soda ""flat"" tasting)."

None. 





Courtside service is slow
no

More healthy choices
hard to cook when they don't have the space for a real kitchen at the stands
don't sell out. the hometown touch of usingers in the rafters for the poor people is great. and jakes downstairs for the rich is pretty cool too
More variety and faster service would be nice.
I believe there r plenty of good choices & I'm always interested to c what's available
No

Bad food


Nothing
Nope
No
"For the prices, there should be more variety"


I remember a special pricing on soda and popcorn. Those are always appreciated by me when I bring my 2 boys. That way we can get hot dogs and something for the second half.
The menu could add a little more variety!
"more specials,    more variety,"
"The food variety is good bit the prices are ridiculous for a family of 6 or just a family. I think y'all would get more bought in the concession stands in y'all cut the prices down,"
no


no
More selection and better prices. 
no

I would like to know where different kinds of food are available.
Just to have a few more options like different burgers or different types of sandwiches and a variety like at a baseball game
"keep up the new, cool offerings!"
Particularly on the upper level all the food options are very similar. If there was something more unique I'd be more likely to order it.
It sucked they had no change I received quarters very very slow service and long lines it was a total disappointment. I've been to Bulls pacers games and this was by far the worst service ever
"It's gotten better each of the past two years--both in service and in quality--but it's still terrible. The service is the worst part. Way too slow, and frequently done with a total lack of interest in the customer. The lines get so long that the people waiting in line end up blocking the concourse so that people can't get to their seats without bumping into a bunch of people, asking them to clear a path, etc. Also, i sometimes look at the line and don't even bother because it would take to long. That's money that the Bucks are loosing."
more selections hire quality
"Nope, they've done a good job of expanding their menu choices in recent years and I'd like to see that continue."
"More sweet treat options needed, as games are late and we are looking for dessert."

None
More variety of snack items would be nice.
No
Beer


Keep the $3 Beers in section 415

No.
"Wish it wasn't so expensive, but that's what it's like at every sporting event. It's just a reality that we have to live with."
Healthier options
"Cheap beer is always good - happy hour promo, e.g."

for the price that is paid for the food portions don't match up.


I wish the prices were a little more affordable for families.
There were a lot of great food options.
Condiments aren't always available or convenient. We miss Saz's. The custom burgers are dry & seem to come out of a food truck instead of being fresher food. The steak sub took 20 minutes. Would prefer 'restaurant' foods instead of 'fast' foods. Bring in Cousins Subs...

no




I like the new chicken tender flavor.



"there isn't much variety between stands, hot dogs should be grilled and not steamed."
Do promotions like the Brewers - $1 hot dog and $1 small soda days.
"I always felt like this was an area they always cut corners on, tried to make it better, however failed. I don't have a problem paying more however they aren't delivering."
change menus more often. Same food every time


I love the Tap House. Great service and a decent selection of beer.

Bring down the cost and I'll purchase. Allow water bottles at the BMO
No

"Between tickets and travel, going to games is expensive. More reasonably priced food and beverages would be nice."

NO
"As mentioned previously, additional food choices is always good. There seems to be a number of booths with the same choices."


no
"More options would be nice (offer fries in more places, more places to serve pizza, more creative options)"


Add kettle corn to menu
no



Horrible.




No
It's awful. Just crap to eat. Where's a nice deli sandwich or a wrap or something a little healthy. Where's GOOD pizza? We live in the best pizza area in the US! Broaden the offerings and remember the kids.
"i dont buy food, just drinks - could have more variety / lower prices.. but no big complaints"
There needs to be more stands that sell buffalo chicken tenders. The ONE stand that does is sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo slow.


Soda is way to expensive.
NO
"lower prices for basics, hot dogs, popcorn, etc"

Cheaper alcohol


Area for cocktails would be nice. 



More variety of beer.
"I would love to see water bottles sold cheaper. I would buy them if they were. Would love to have items sold in the upper level with people walking up and down the isles. Here's a fun idea ... may a number to text with the order you want. I never want to miss the game, but my son will go stand in line to get something."

Grease. Enough said. Beer costs too much.
Additional offerings would be great.
need more
None
none
they could have game day food and drink specials

no

Love the $3 Coors light promotions    
"food is generally low quality. On occasion, the courtside club might have something of quality but few and far between"
none

"The food & beverage lines interfere with the traffic patterns of people circulating in the concourses, trying to navigate the facility. FIX THIS (Place concessions toward the outside of concourses?) !!"
There is a lack of healthy choices
"Last time I was there, I was very disappointed that they replaced the cheese steak cart with spam sandwiches."
The engagement of some employees could be better. SOme outlets are hit and miss on service levels.
"Change the top level. I would like my food hot not warm. Lower the price. I hate buying a beer from a vendor on the 2nd level cuz thats where i bought my food, then going up to the 3rd level and seeing that beer is cheaper!"

Make it quicker so I can watch the game

Beverage prices are way too high
more choices and better food

No.
more variety the better

"Selections for vegans/vegetarians are fairly nonexistent. If you don't eat meat and don't drink alcohol or soda, you have very little options. The time it takes to get through a line on a non marquee game takes way too long. When it is a sold out game, it makes sense. MVPs should have a express lane. Even a way to order off your phone to then just pickup. Most areas have this already."
no
"It's usually pretty good, but too expensive to buy on a regular basis."
"I'd love to see more local vendors, The Brewers have several Milwaukee favorite restaurants with kiosks in stadium."
Overall very good. Maybe more food variety 
impressed with the food offerings this year espically in the mvp club


The options and quality have improved dramatically in the past 3 years
Lines can be slow at times.

"We enjoy the craft beers. Wish there were more places that sold craft beers. Usually go to area restaurants before games, as the selection and price are better than can be found in the arena (especially the beer prices)."

More selections inside the arena
"I am a senior and cannot eat fried food, I suggest some form of salads are offered as a variety."



MORE VARIETY OF HEALTHIER OPTIONS
Just way too expensive. Doesn't need to be $5-7 per drink

no

"sometimes very slow, in the upper bowl only one server for drinks. "


no

Beer prices are to expensive


last year was better

"The new owners downgraded the buffet this year. Under Senator Kohl, the food was better. Also the new owners are serve the buffet on cheap paper plates."




"Not a big foodie, but the Courtside club is OK the hot dog type stands are very average. The packer serve some ""only at Lambeau items that make the experience unique."
More variety at reasonable price
More beer options at more stands selling craft & micro beers.
Seems okay
not really a good selection in the upper bowl. ketchup always run out quickly
more choices are always welcome
"The lines can be painfully long at times. Do not have many soda selections - only the same 5 Pepsi products. Food and beverages are way overpriced, just like any other sporting event. Prevents me from spending more at the games (eating dinner at the arena, buying beer at the arena, etc.)."
"It's quite expensive, but beer at any sporting event aint cheap"
Would like to see local restaurants become invested in the arena. I believe it would make sense to have a full service restaurant part of the new arena that is accessible both during and not during games.

Love all the local brew choices

Very disappointed that the cheesesteak stand is now a taco stand.

Staff brought a Shirley Temple & lots of napkins when I need them!!
Long lines at times and slow 

They took Saz out don't know why but like it.    Little more variety of food or combo meals
One time 2 years ago on dollar hot dog day I received a moldy bun. not good but it was only a buck. Other then that prices are expensive everywhere I guess.
No

No
Nothen


"At times food has been sitting too long: dried out burgers & hot dogs, lettuce & tomato wilted, cheese cold, popcorn chewy / stale. Slow service, not enough cashiers at times"
"Last time i had a ot dog, it was hard to chew cuz the wrapper was not taken off. Sorry to say his, but the hot dog offered at sam's for third of the price are three time better. Get those if you can, please!"
More places like the Uesinger Hut and the craft beer place. 
Brown mustard should be available near concessions in the upper bowl as well as the lower.

"There is very little perceived value in arena dining, and if this is not remedied, people will get wise to it and get their food and drink elsewhere before or after the game. Why should I pay $7 for a boiled cheeseburger when I could get a fast food burger that is better for a few dollars less, or a great burger for that price or a few dollars more, outside of the arena?"
very slow at times. at times have poor knowledge of ticket promotions such as vouchers for beverage in a ticket package

way to high priced for the quanity and quality
a much broader selection of food and drinks I badly needed and some should be priced more economically as to sell more and make them more attractive to the average customer
No 


Should provide cheaper options
Have more options for food

"It's expensive, but there's a variety of types of food."
How about some kosher offerings and non fried fish offerings.        Hot fudge sundaes should be available.
over priced

vey expensive



"Offer items other than the basics that you would see at a high school game..nachos, hot dogs, etc. Try to come up with some unique dishes and some better quality. Nobody wants to pay $15 for a warm hot dog and a beer."
no

We need the new arena with new facilities - that wil fix it all I hope 
none

Always like an upgrade in quality and choices


No
Make sure the soda lines are flushed. 
NO

Hot dogs are always great!


The only healthy option is raw veggies at grill 71

same as before - long lines for desserts/ice cream at halftime/3rd quarter. Miss a lot of the 2nd half waiting. very inefficient.
"Needs more variety, better quality, more ""home"" food. Wisconsin or Milwaukee type food. Incorporate Milwaukee into food."

I would like to see organic food options at the arena moving forward. 
The experience has always been fine. The service is better than that of the United Center.

So many selections I wish I could try them all
The bartenders in the MVP club are super friendly and we always get a big smile from them when we come in.
I'd like the doors to open sooner so i can sit and dine.
Make sure the servers and runners are aware that a game is going on and they do not block the view of the fans

How about offering a kids snack option with a kids drink and a kid size pretzel. We eat before the game and it's pretty pricey for each child to get a drink and a pretzel.
Many upper level stands are not always open which is inconvenient. Wish wait staff was more efficient.
None
more variety needed

More variety. Kids items should be value priced


"I don't expect arena food to be fantastic, but it's very adequate"

None


Make sure people stay friendly and inviting

More seating is needed
No


to pricey
Just was not hungry
no one vendor/service supply should have an exclusive contract. $4 for a bottle of water is in appropriate. There is a lack of food choices that are not fried etc. they are working on some improvements
More healthy options would be nice that aren't insanely expensive. I bought a small green food smoothie which was very good but almost 8 bucks.
Great beer selection
More servers - faster service
I wish there was a coffee kiosk.    Would also like some healthier choices
More local craft beer and more IPAs!




The new additions this year are great! I've also never had a bad meal in the MVP Club
Have more choices including 5-10 different ethnic choices. More places so lines aren't to long if you want to go out during game.
No
no
I would like more options 
None 
"Mix it up, and prices don't need to be that high. I usually just eat before or after the game outside the arena because the choices and prices inside are not appealing."
need more healthy options

"The food isn't very good. Besides, I don't want to juggle food in my cramped seat."
Outrageous price for a slice of pizza
The food and beer choices are very good.
seems kiosk staffing getting worse
no
try lowering the prices
Just need better food and to speed up service drastically.
"Inconsistent lines... I never know if it will take me 5 min or 25 min to get food or drink, and this affectd my decision to go buy or not"
No 

Faster service
Often run out of specialty items. Many staff are slow and unknowledgable.
slow service. Volunteers are not familiar with the process and are slow 
No

No.

last time food quantity was smaller than past


More local options in the Club area. Be more like Miller Park. 

Great arena food!

good choices available.

Good and drinks were good and the service was good 
No.

Need more choices
No
More cheap/half price/free with ticket purchase food nights!!!

Pepsi is always better than Coke!
Need the variety to be more accessible. I am severely disabled. I being my mentally disabled cousin. He wants pizza. There is only one place to get pizza on the entire floor. Very hard to do.

better selections are welcomed.
Expand food choices review taste of burger meat- review cooking time of    Hot dogs and brat-brat looks half cooked-Jakes need a grill    So    That grilled corned beef can be ordered -( contact Brewers and copy some of their menu items
Two comments - 1) More efficient counter staff (I realize most of these individuals are supporting some charitable organization); 2) If a food item (e.g. grill chicken) is being cooked from scratch a published projected preparation time would be informative. I missed nearly an entire quarter of play for one game. Never ordered from that location again.


Could do better. Consistently better.
"Really like MVP time warner club, like micro brew station, love roasted nuts"
Time/long lines are also factors.
Healthier options including beverages would be helpful

I typically go to the Wisconsin Club and eat there prior to the game. I seldom purchase food because I would like more choices and better quality wine selection

"I prefer to spend my limited, fixed income on tickets instead. Also, I would consider buying food, if offered food with a local flavor, rather than the ""generic arena concessions"" typically offered by Levy. I only saw one ""Fish Fry"" available (at Grille 71) which is a local staple. I savored Q-Doba's chicken burritos, until they raised their prices."

Too expensive for the quality received
eat before I go to the game. sometimes eat there on week nights if I go straight to the game from work.





Don't want to spend the money. Typically try and eat beforehand. Will get beer sometimes and food every once in a while. Enjoy the cheap Coors beer deal on certain nights for the 1st quarter.
